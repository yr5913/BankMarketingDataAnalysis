This file indicates contributions of individual in the project
===============Shravani Athkuri======================
1) MYSQL database setup
2) Reading data from excel and storing it in db
3) Reading data from database into application for analysis
4) Worked on descriptive statistics for categorical columns and listed different unique categories in each column
5) Plotted Kernel density graph for numerical columns to visualize the more dense and sparse regions in each column
6) Worked on scarceness and correlation plots for numerical columns, plotted heatmap to visualize the correlation between columns
7) Worked on data encoding using label encoding and converted categorical columns to numerical values which helped for better training of models
8) Performed Oversampling which balanced the data
9) Trained the classification models Decision Tree and Random Forest Classifier models and published the results
10) Collated the results of different classification modela and plotted bar graphs for better visualize the performance metrics of all models trained
11) Completed the Status and Future Work sections in the project report

===============Anvesh Sai Vemuri==========================
1) Performed descriptive statistics on the data for each numerical value listing the mean, count and sum of each columns
2) Used Inter Quartile Range method and calculated the Lower Quartile Outliers
3) Plotted graphs to visualize the counts of each category in all categorical columns of the data set
4) Performed Normalization of numerical columns of the data set using min max normalization
5) Trained the classification models Logistic Regression and Stochastic Gradient Descent and published the results
6) Completed the project poster
7) Worked on legal and ethical sections of the report

================Subba Reddy Karri=========================
1) Used Inter Quartile Range method and calculated the Upper Quartile Outliers
2) Plotted graphs to visualize the target column distribution with respect to each numerical column
3) Worked on data cleanup to find the missing values in the data
4) Trained the classification models Gaussian NB and K Neighbors models and published the results
5) Completed the contributions text to list all the contributions of team members
6) Worked on the project report and completed the analysis and design and implementation sections
7) Gathered all the important screenshots and the data required for the report and completed the project report

================Yugesh Reganti=============================
1) Selected the data set for the project
2) Worked on database setup and storing data into database
3) Plotted Box and Whisker plots to visualize the outliers in the numerical columns
